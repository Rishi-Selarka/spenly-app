TROUBLESHOOTING
========================================

"Please add your FREE Gemini API key"
→ You didn't replace the key in GeminiManager.swift

"Invalid API key"
→ Check you copied the full key correctly
→ Make sure it starts with AIzaSy...

"Quota exceeded"
→ You hit 60 requests/minute limit
→ Wait 1 minute and try again
→ Very rare for normal usage

"No internet connection"
→ Gemini needs internet to work

========================================
COST COMPARISON
========================================

OpenAI GPT-4o-mini: $3-5/month
Google Gemini: FREE! ✅

Gemini is:
- Completely free
- No credit card
- Smart enough for Spenly
- 60 requests/min limit (plenty)

========================================
FREE TIER LIMITS
========================================

- 60 requests per minute
- 1500 requests per day
- No daily cost limit

For a personal finance app, this is MORE than enough!
Even power users won't hit these limits.

========================================
PRIVACY
========================================

Both OpenAI and Gemini:
- Send data to cloud (need internet)
- Your transactions are included in requests
- Google's privacy policy applies
- Data not used for training (by default)

If privacy is concern, stick with if-else code (offline).
